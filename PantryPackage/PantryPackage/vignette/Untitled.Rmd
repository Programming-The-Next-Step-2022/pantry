## Explaining "What's in my pantry?"

The shiny app takes ingredient and diet input and gives the recipe title, 
ingredients and url.

## The input

```{r input, eval = FALSE}
diets <- c("None", "Pescatarian" ,"Vegetarian", "Vegan", "Gluten Free",
              "Dairy Free", "Soy Free", "Pork Free")

ui <- fluidPage(
    title = "What's in the pantry?",
    textInput("ingredient", "What do you have?",
              placeholder = "e.g., tomato"), # ingredient input
    selectInput("diet", "dietary restrictions?",
                choices = diets), # diet input
    textOutput("recipe")
    )
```

Here is my code, IF I COULD GET IT TO WORK
